Here are the Main parts of our project: 


where you can access the Angular front-end using the All-IN-ONE-JACKET folder



the Backend using the Server Folder



The arduino code using the FV.ino file 



To know how to let them work kindly open every folder since it will have a readme file.



note that you can always check the code functionality without setting anything up locally since the project is available on the cloud using this link: https://all-in-one-jacket.web.app/home



you just need to buy your own arduino and do the required sensor wiring and use the code uploaded in the FV.ino on your arduino: https://github.com/Elie0/All-in-one-jacket/blob/main/FV.ino
